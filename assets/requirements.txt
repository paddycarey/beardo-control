# Python requirements that will be installed using `pip` when the container is
# built. Since the appengine application is the only app on the container we
# care about, we won't bother with a virtualenv, instead installing the
# packages system-wide.
#
# NOTE: These packages are only those required for testing or other
# development purposes. Those libraries required at runtime *MUST* be
# installed into the `app/vendor/` directory and committed to source control.
